nohup nice -n 10 ./add_d_cuda.plx sample OUTmax

# Run the run_add_d_cuda.plx script and give the directory of the tracks of the players are.
# run_localcorr.plx will run the same script but instead of analysing the match at once it will 
# do it one by one for each pair. This will make it much faster.
# Note: the script was tested and run on
# linux (Ubuntu, 18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver), 4.15.0-43-generic) using
# perl 5, version 26, subversion 1 (v5.26.1) built for x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi
